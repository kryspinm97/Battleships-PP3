## Rules of the Game

1. Player will be given a set of rules on the start of the game.
2. Board Area is set of 10 x 10 Grid.
3. The player has a number of missiles to guess the position of the computers ships.
4. The misses will be marked down as X.
5. The hits will be marked down as O.
6. Player will have the ability to play again after all the missiles run out. Displaying the score of how many ships were hit during that game.
