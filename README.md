# Project 3 - Battleships

Here I have created a Battleships game that is ran inside the Python Terminal window,
which is also styled by the Code Institute Terminal Template. 


## * Game Rules *

The goal of the game is to guess the enemy's battleship position that is dictated by the Game Board, positions of the ships are random and the user has to destroy all the ships to win.
You will be given a set number of missiles to shoot down the ships before the game is over.

Misses will be marked as -X

Ships that were hit will be marked as - O

# Features
